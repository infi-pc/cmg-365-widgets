# CMG 365-Widgets

## Description

The CMG 365 Widgets library is a quality control tool used to analyze log files from 365-Widgets' home sensors including thermometers, humidistats, and carbon monoxide detectors. It evaluates sensor performance against defined criteria and categorizes them as "ultra precise", "very precise", "precise", or discards them based on their readings compared to a known reference.
